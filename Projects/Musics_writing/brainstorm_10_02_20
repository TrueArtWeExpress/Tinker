Black Hearths enslaved weak souls depraved, human greed is utterly vicious, we can no longer be saved.

A superior race consumed by greed
An evolved species with nothing but needs
egotistical individuals leading the masses
Their paths filled with casualties, lost lives and carcasses. 

Society is the proof that humans are no more then mere emotional cows
walking face down, ignoring anything around them, blend in while following the herd.
