You gotta be loud
You gotta be rude
So the world can hear you
You gotta be crass
You gotta be cold
It's everything we know
Turn it up, turn it up now
Loud
Rude
When nobody hears you
You gotta stand up
You gotta commit
Say "fuck it", make the best of it

---------------------

Let me live my life
I can go get my knife
Or I can pull out the one that you stuck in my back
For my suffering, you've got nothing to gain
My pain is your entertainment
