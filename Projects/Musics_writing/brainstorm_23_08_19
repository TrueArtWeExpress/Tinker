I've been digging true the dirt
pushing my flesh and skin to the limit while challenging my mental health up to the breaking point
On hands and knees I've been crawling true quicksand hiding my scars and ignoring my fears.

Until I stumbled on the inside of a pitch black rotten core.
The doors behind me slammed shut and the path in front of me evaporated as a pile of ash in the wind.
I found myself alone in a indescribable void with an emptiness in my soul that goes beyond my vocabulary.

Day became night and night became day and sleep did not exist.
Everything blurred into a constant struggle between surviving the moment and trying to avoid the next one in vain.

Senses peak and hit rock bottom at will - emotions taking over and disappear just as quickly.
Agony and anxiety feasting on my soul while guilt and shame consume my conscience.
My hearth runs cold, my thoughts turn dark and my soul decays to an empty whole that sits somewhere at the height of my diaphragm.

.......
Contracting of pain, screaming with no end,

Just me, some of my worst memories and my demons that hitched a ride in my mind.
Tortured by all I've seen all, all I've done and all that I should have done.
