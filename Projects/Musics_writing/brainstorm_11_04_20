<< Waking up >>

Feeling like I just Resurrected from fucking purgatory.
I stare at what appears to be a concrete wall of gloomy cynical thoughts.
Darkness still lingers in the dawn while a dense fog blurs my sight.
Lethargy is amplified true out my conscience making everything look so god damn pointless.
Yet ....





<< Every single day - Here we fucking go again >>
