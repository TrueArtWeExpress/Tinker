Do I feel anxiety or just complete insanity.
I can't tell you what is wrong because I don't understand what's going on.

I'm pinned down, locked, in chains I can not break
I don't know where they come from or how much more I can take.

-------------------------------------------------------

I'm taken over again by this feeling.
A feeling I can't explain.
I'm trying to fight it, but it feels hopeless.

It feels like I'm missing the weapons to get this demon to it's knees.
I can't tell you what it looks like or how it makes me feel because this is so different from normal feelings.
I can not come up with a name for it as no name suits how it makes me feel

-------------------------------------------------------------------

<< THE DEMON IS OUT ONES MORE >>

I've been taken over again by a feeling I can't explain.
All my efforts to overcome this... every struggle is in vain.



My attempts to tell you how I feel

It's like a glowing wave that pulses outward in a circular motion, starting from my diaphragm.
