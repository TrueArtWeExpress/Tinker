Have you ever felt misunderstood ?
I mean like, really misunderstood, that it frustrates you.
In fact it does not only frustrates you it makes you sad, angry, frustrated and desperate at the same time.

So misunderstood that you would beat the common sense into somebody.
Or so misunderstood that you would be prepared to relentlessly cut off one of your fingers

The root of my issue can be found in the fact that throughout my entire life,
for every single time I really tried and gave it my all,
there was a person ready to show me that it was not enough.

Tell me,
If you really give everything you got and because of doing that, actually believe you are doing things right and even feel a bit proud of it.
How would you feel if someone just runs in an says you're performing really poorly ?
It hurts doesn't it ?

<< Well fuck that! >>

<< HERE WE GO AGAIN >>

'This silence is making me feel awkward' you say
I'm replying to you that I'm thinking.
'Please say something' you say
I'm replying I don't know what to say
'Can't you see what this is doing to me' you say
I remain silent

<< DEAR GOD >>

I wish I could give you a peak inside my head at this point.
because event tough you seem to know me quite well, it does not seem to come true how far gone I am at this point.
because while you were focusing on your issue, trying to make me give you the answer you want to hear so bad, my world is literally crumbling around me.
I look emotionless, ignorant and not responsive.

<< AT HIS VERY MOMENT I AM IN A WAY >>

Thoughts pop up from all sides like hungry wolfs eager to devour my every bit.
Thousands of them have surrounded me in no more ten a blink of an eye.
My fight or flight signals are both flickering at the same time causing me to freeze.

Every path and every shelter in my head is filled with them. There is no way out.

<< I CAN'T COPE >>

-------------------------------

To you I'm ignorant or just not understanding enough.
Sometimes it even seems as if you're implying I'm selfish
