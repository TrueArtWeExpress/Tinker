every scar will build my trone
if you don't know where you are going, any road will take you there
I'm on the wrong side of heaven and the rightous side of hell
I'd love to change the world, but they won't give me the source code.

Good men won't speak because they're scared of the violence
But bad men keep screaming to fill up the silence
< Machine Head - Volatile >

I reach for calm
I starve for a balance unknown
This burden tortures me deep in my soul
< Trivium - Strife >
--------------

Because anything exceptional
Gets crushed by common people
With jealousy and ignorance
And all that common evils
< Slipknot - Custer >
