insecurity, anxiety and voices in my head.
surround my common sense with madness and my conscience with regrets.

Society is a myth created by the upper tier to keep us all in line.
Society talks about harmony and yet only a few of us fit in.
Society should be fought by does who are themselves.

If you can't be yourself, you can't 'be' add all.
Masses rule individuals with boundaries and standards.

I don't seem to fit in to any group, environment or community.
My standards are considered wrong as they don't fit the general view.
But if I live by the general view I get depressed up to the point that I do not want to live anymore.

It's proven my head does not work the same, it's a different machine from most of the brains.
Doesn't it seem logic that is should be able to have other standards then as well ?

Although they think they do control me, I usually get what I wont.
Acting dumb while always planning the next move to my goal is the key to my success.

To describe my head :
 	* It feels as if I never get satisfied.
		Even when I do something considered exceptional I feel like "meh, it's done"
	* I have a constant urge to learn. Not just for pleasure, it is something I really need to do to feel well.
	* I already know that I will die regretfully, as there is just not enough time to do all the things I want in life.
	* I'm using a different ruleset for 'compassion'. Cross the line, expect me to be feeling nothing anymore towards you, even when you die.
	* I think a lot about dying and I really hope it's sudden, as I could not live with the idea of it 'coming closer'.
	* Without a doubt I will literary kill someone to protect the once I love without a single moment of hesitation.
	 	- When a loved one is threatened my sight goes red. This wont lay down as long as the threat is still in sight or in the same building.
	* When extreme incidents happen, I get tunnel vision, - one goal - everything else get kicked out of the way in order to reach it.
		- Don't expect me to reason like you. This is the moment where I have already decided my values and priorities.
			Trying to change them in this particular moment will get you injured.
	* My head often takes over, it feels as if I'm standing in the middle of a city.
	  Every person in that city is talking to me personally and I can't help trying to listen to all of them
	* Focus is rare, if I do focus, it means I love what I'm doing and no other person can reach the same level of focus at that point.
		It's almost like a trance. If I'm not stopped at that point I can go on for 48 hours on the same project without feeling hungry sleepy or bored.
	* I have an urge to do something 'exceptional' something 'noticed by the world'.
		But I do believe this urge comes from the fact that I'm never feeling satisfied on my own work
	* I'm really critical for myself. So critical that I gave myself a low self esteem over time
	  because I always found someone who did it better then me.
	* In my nature I'm a lone wolf, asocial. But for some unexplainable reason people often like me and I end up surrounded by them.
		This is not always as easy as I'm not a fascist who is going to hurt their feelings to get rid of them. I just like to be alone.
