It doesn't matter if you scream and shout because the feelings inside of you will never come out.
So hard to express so difficult to explain that every smile on your face is covered by agonizing pain.
Abandoned, forced to survive on your own. For them to find out in your head you'll always be alone.
Your path was chosen from before you where born, your body will be broken your soul will be thorn.

----------------------------

You will never notice the damage you’ve done, your torture goes on until I am gone.

I passed all my boundary’s, point of no return, you caused al this damage, therefore you must burn

----------------------------

When i arrived at heaven my name was misspelled, the guard sad hold on there son, this is not yet your place you should go back where you came from with  memorys erased.

please Don’t send me back to earth they don’t like me, don’t send me back to that hypocrite hell. Ooh god don’t send me back to that earth it’s pure evil,
Can’t you just give me a date with the devil himself ?

----------------------------

My Hearth is dark my vision is red, somethings wrong in my head.

----------------------------

Go hard and go far to find out who you are
Then just be yourself and reach for the stars

Search In your hearth for what you want to be don’t look at others and you will be free

We wont live forever it’s meant by design so let go of hate and open your mind

----------------------------

There it is, the buttons got pushed, vision gets blurry , common sense gets flushed.

Locked into a void of sadness and despair. No one else will notice no one else will care.

No use to fight it, you wont stand a chance. Just try to embrace it as destruction commences.

Pain and agony is all that awaits. Your soul will be devoured but this is your faith.

This won't make you stronger this won't make you tough. It will just keep going on until you had enough.

Your thoughts get darker your sight colors black. This is the moment you're allowed to go back.


Released into the world with your mind out of control . Destined to hurt anyone on your path




Soul devoured, spirit destroyed.
