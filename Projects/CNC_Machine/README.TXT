1.
	//PROBLEM - Soft Iron Axis show form of rust
	//NOTE - Temporary maintained with WD40
	//TODO - Buy + add chromes axis

2.
	//PROBLEM - Hight of axis is not high enough for deep milling
	//NOTE - This probably can wait untill the rebuild for CNC Spindle

3.
	//IDEA - Think on making the X-Bridge smaller to gain extra dimention
	//NOTE - Keep in mind that sturdieness can not be lost

4.
 	//IDEA - add vvaccuum cleaner extension to the spindle head
	//NOTE - This can be integrated into the rebuild for Spindle
5.
	//IDEA - Print Y axis in 1 piece to gain sturdieness
	//NOTE - Check the printability of this idea
